## Why start this project？
1. A few months ago, I participated in an AWD offensive and defensive game and found that collecting POC in advance is very good way, and I can learn a lot in the process of collecting these `payloads`.
2. Subsequent HW, CTF, or daily infiltration activities can quickly locate and exploit.
