# cve-2020-8597-pptpd
You can use this code to verify if your PPTPD server is likely vulnerable to CVE-2020-8597 vulnerability. 
Usage
prompt# ./pptp_poc.py
Usage ./pptp_poc.py PPTP_Server to test for CVE-2020-8597

prompt# ./pptp_poc.py 172.19.12.21
Initiating communications with PPTP server 172.19.12.21
Connected to PPTP server, now sending large buffer to peer to attempt buffer overflow
Server 172.19.12.21 is likely vulnerable, did not return anything after EAP packet 

prompt# DEBUG=1 ./pptp_poc.py 172.19.12.24
Initiating communications with PPTP server 172.19.12.24
.... debug info ....
Connected to PPTP server, now sending large buffer to peer to attempt buffer overflow
Server 172.19.12.24 is likely vulnerable, did not return anything after EAP packet

prompt# ./pptp_poc.py 172.19.12.254
Initiating communications with PPTP server 172.19.12.254
Connected to PPTP server, now sending large buffer to peer to attempt buffer overflow
Server 172.19.12.254 is likely NOT vulnerable to buffer overflow
Verifying peer 172.19.12.254 one more time using a Echo request to the peer 
Received a normal PPP Echo Reply, System is mostly likely NOT vulnerable
