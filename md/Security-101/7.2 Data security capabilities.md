**Introduction**

In this lesson, we’ll cover:

- What is data loss prevention tooling?

- What is insider risk management tooling?

- What data retention tooling is available?

## What is data loss prevention tooling?

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tooling refers to a set of software solutions and technologies designed to prevent unauthorized access, sharing, or leakage of sensitive or confidential data within an organization. These tools use content inspection, policy enforcement, and monitoring to identify and protect sensitive data from being exposed or misused. Example DLP products include: Symantec Data Loss Prevention, McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention, Microsoft 365 DLP**: Integrates with Microsoft 365 applications to help organizations identify and protect sensitive data within emails, documents, and messages.

## What is insider risk management tooling?

Insider Risk Management tooling helps organizations identify and mitigate risks posed by employees, contractors, or partners who may intentionally or unintentionally compromise data security. These tools monitor user behavior, access patterns, and data usage to detect suspicious activities and potential insider threats. Example insider risk management products include: Microsoft Insider Risk Management (part of Microsoft 365), Forcepoint Insider Threat Data Protection, Varonis Insider Threat Detection.

## What data retention tooling is available?

Data retention tooling includes software and solutions designed to manage the retention and deletion of data in accordance with an organization's data retention policies and legal requirements. These tools help automate the process of retaining data for specific durations and securely deleting it when it is no longer needed. Example data retention products include: Veritas Enterprise Vault, Commvault Complete Data Protection, Microsoft data lifecycle management. These tooling solutions help organizations maintain control over data retention and disposal, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations while efficiently managing data throughout its lifecycle.
