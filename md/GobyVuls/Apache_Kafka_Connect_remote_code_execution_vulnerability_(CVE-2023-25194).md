| **Description**  | 	Apache Druid is an open source distributed data storage and analysis system. It is designed to handle large-scale real-time data and provide fast interactive query and analysis.Apache Druid uses the vulnerable Kafka Connect. An attacker can access the Kafka Connect Worker and create or modify the connector by setting the sasl.jaas.config attribute to a malicious class, which can lead to a JNDI injection vulnerability. This vulnerability can be used Execute code arbitrarily on the server side, write backdoors, obtain server permissions, and then control the entire web server. |
