# S2-046 (CVE-2017-5638) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

The Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 has incorrect exception handling and error-message generation during file-upload attempts, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted Content-Type, Content-Disposition, or Content-Length HTTP header, as exploited in the wild in March 2017 with a Content-Type header containing a #cmd= string.

**Affected version**: Apache Struts2 2.3.5 - 2.3.31 and 2.5.x - 2.5.10

**[FOFA](https://fofa.so/result?qbase64=YXBwPSJTdHJ1dHMyIg%3D%3D) query rule**: app="Struts2"
